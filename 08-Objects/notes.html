    <!--
    An object groups multiple values together.
        - On the left of the : we have the property. 
        - We can console.log the property. 
        - We can also use the property to make changes to certain values. 
        - To make an object, we enclose all the information inside of {}. 
        - Inside the {}, we can put multiple values. It follows the property: value. 
        - It is called the property value pair. 
        - We can add new properties by simply doing objectname.propertyname = ""
        - We can remove new properties by doing delete objectname.propertyname

        - We use objects to make our code easier to read. It helps us use multiple values together.
