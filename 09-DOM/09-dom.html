    <!--
    The DOM is another built in object. It gives Javascript full control of the webpage. The most common tool that we will be using 
    is "document". We use the dot notation because we are accessing a property of the document. 
    • The document object is linked to the webpage. This represents/models the webpage. 
    • The DOM combines HTML and Javascript together.
    -->


    <!--
    Syntax Rules
        • If we change certain properties in the DOM, it also changes in the webpage. 
        • There are also methods that we can use with document. 
    -->


    <!--
    Properties and Methods
        • document.title is used to get the title of the webpage.
        
        • document.body is used to get the actual body from the HTML code. It returns the code and when we hover over, it shows 
        exactly what is inside the body. This is the most important feature because it shows we can have HTML inside Javascript.
        • When an HTML element is inside Javascript, the element is converted into a Javascript object. 

        • document.body.innerHTML returns all of the HTML from the webpage. This gives us control of all the HTML in the body. 
        • Using innerHTML, we can also replace the HTML with buttons or headers or footers, etc. We can replace it to whatever we want.
        • Every HTML element has a property called .innerHTML which lets us control the element and that can be represented by
        document.body.querySelector('button').innerHTML

        Now onto methods. A method is a function saved inside an object.

        • document.querySelector('element') lets us get any element from the page and put it inside Javascript.
        • This gets any element from the page and puts it inside Javascript.

    <script>
    /*
      document.body.innerHTML = 'hello' //this removes everything on the page and replaces it with hello.
      document.title = "LeBron James" //this changes the title at the top of the tab
    */


    /*
    console.log(document.title) //this returns the name of the webpage in the console.
    console.log(document.body) //this returns everything inside the body
    console.log(typeof document.body) //returns object
    console.log(document.body.innerHTML) //returns all of the HTML on the site
    */

    
    console.log(document.querySelector('button')) //this gets the button from HTML and puts it inside our Javascript
    console.log(document.querySelector('button').innerHTML) //this just returns the HTML inside the button
    console.log(document.querySelector('.js-button')) //this now looks for a class called js-button, that is why we need the . in the front
    console.log(document.querySelector('.js-button').innerHTML) //this just returns the HTML inside the button now too


    const secondButtonElement = document.querySelector('.js-button')
    console.log(secondButtonElement)
