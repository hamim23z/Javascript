    <!--
    An array is another type of value in Javascript and it stores values
    We represent an array as [] with values inside. 
    Typically, let myArray = [1, 2, 3] is what it looks like. 

    To get the specific value for an array, what we typically do is use [] as well. 
    For us, it looks like myValue[0] and if we console.log it, we get 1. Because we start from index 0.
    console.log(myValue[0]) returns 10.

    And because Javascript reads from the top down, we can change the value of elements inside an array too. 
    Say we want to change the first value, we will do something like myNewValue[0] = 100. So 1 becomes 100.

    Inside an array, must be separated by commas.
    Array values can be on multiple lines. 
    We always start with index 0. 
    Inside an array, can put any type of value, string, int, float, boolean, another array, etc.
    An array is an object.

    When we use typeof, console.log(typeof [1,2]) we get an object.
    When we use Array.isArray([1,2]) we get true.

    Arrays have properties. We can use .length, .push(value) (what push does is add a value to the end of an array).
    .splice(value1, value2) (what splice does it remove values from an array. value1 is index and value2 is how many)

    <!--
    While Loops:
    While a certain condition is true, we will do something. But as soon as that condition is false, it terminates and we 
    exit the while loop. We have initial variable, loop condition, loop body, and increment/decrement.
    initial_variab;e = value
    while (condition) {code black}

    For Loop:
    It does the same thing as a while loop but it is a lot shorter. The syntax is much more simpler too. There are three things we need
    the initial variable, condition, and increment decrement step
    for (i=1; i<=5; i++) {code block}

    Looping Through an Array:
    We will go through each element of an array and then do something with it.
